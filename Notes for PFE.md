Python scripts
Interactive Python is good for experiements and program of 3-4 lines long.
Most programs are much longer, so its best to type them into a file and tell Python to run the commands in the file.
As a convention add ".py" as teh suffix at the end of the file to indicate it contains Python.

Program Steps or Flow
A program is a sequence of steps to be done in order.
Some steps are conditional and may be skipped.
Some steps or groups of steps may be repeated.
Sometimes as set of steps needs to be stored so it can be used over and over again.

Loops have iteration variables that change each time through a loop.
Example:<br>
n = 5<br>
while n > 0:<br>
  print(n)<br>
  n = n - 1<br>
print('Houston we have lift off!')<br>
